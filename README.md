## **Tools and Techniques Used**

### **Advanced Excel Functions**
- Functions like `VLOOKUP`, `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, and `INDEX-MATCH` for data extraction and merging.  
- PivotTables and PivotCharts for summarization and analysis.  
- Conditional formatting to highlight critical insights.  
- Report connections for linking multiple PivotTables and slicers for dynamic filtering.  
- Date functions like `DATE` and `YEAR` for date manipulation.  

### **SQL Queries**
- Keywords like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING` for data extraction and filtering.  
- Window functions such as `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, and `DENSE_RANK` for calculations on data subsets.  
- Date functions like `DATEADD`, `DATEDIFF`, and `DATEPART` for handling and analyzing date fields.  

### **Tableau Dashboards**
- Features such as **data blending**, **calculated fields**, dimensions, and measures for data organization and visualization.  
- Dynamic **filters and parameters** for interactive dashboards.  
- Visualizations like **maps, charts, and tables** to present insights effectively.
